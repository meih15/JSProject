**bobabreak** is a tea-themed matching game where the player serves as a barista in a bubble-tea shop newly opened in the bustling city of Los Angeles. Hone your barista skills as you take orders and serve customers the drink of their dreams!

## Instructions

**bobabreak** is a tea-themed food matching game. The player will take on the role of the barista that makes the bubble tea orders to serve the correct drink to the customer. Players can use the keyboard or mouse to select components of the drink. Players will have to choose the right cup-size, tea, and the toppings in order to pass the round. The time allotted for each drink order will decrease after a certain amount of customers to increase difficulty over the course of gameplay. The player will be given three lives. A wrong order or order not completed in time will result in a customer lost, aka life lost. Losing all three lives will result in a game over.
